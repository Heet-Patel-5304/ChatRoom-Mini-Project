# ChatRoom-Mini-Project

A real-time chat room application built using **Node.js**, **Socket.io**, and basic **HTML** and **CSS**.
This ChatRoom project is a mini-project created to apply and demonstrate the backend skills I have learned, particularly focusing on real-time communication using Node.js and Socket.io. It provides a simple chat room where multiple users can join and exchange messages in real-time.

# Project Overview

The ChatRoom project is a hands-on implementation of real-time web application concepts that I have learned during my backend development studies. It illustrates how server-side logic can be integrated with real-time, event-driven communication to deliver a seamless user experience.

The backend is developed using Node.js, which manages the server-side logic and client connections.
Socket.io is utilized to implement real-time, bidirectional communication, allowing users to instantly send and receive messages without needing to reload the page.
The frontend remains deliberately simple, using only HTML and CSS, to ensure the focus remains on understanding and demonstrating core backend functionalities.
